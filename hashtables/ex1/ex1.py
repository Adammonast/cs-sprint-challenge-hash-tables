    # implement function that finds two items whose SUM of weight EQUALS the weight limit
    # function returns a tuple of integers ---> (zero, one)
    # each element represents the item weights of the two packages
    # The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index
    # If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist: function should return `None`.
    # linear time - as input increases, runtime/space used will grow at the SAME rate

    # check the length first
